As an AI, I can't generate code or files based on the provided information. However, I can tell you that the "readme.md" and "requirements.txt" files don't typically share dependencies. 

The "readme.md" file is a markdown file used for documentation. It explains what the project is about, its features, how to install and use it, and other relevant information. 

On the other hand, the "requirements.txt" file is a plain text file that lists the Python packages required to run the project. 

There are no shared dependencies, exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names between these two files. They serve different purposes and contain different types of information. The "readme.md" file contains human-readable text, while the "requirements.txt" file contains machine-readable text.
